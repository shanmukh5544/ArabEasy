# this is about the project submitted.

all the details are given below .


# production environment.
i have used Netlify for my production.

arabeasy.netlify.app

for production in react we only deploy the BUILD folder for deploying all the things.

# https://arabeasy.netlify.app/

# ci-cd pipeline for this.

npm run build is the comand for updation and build of my application.

i do have another method for deployment.

# firebase.

where we use firebase tools to create our envirement for deploying.

like firebae init

firebase deploy etc:-

we can host and all over here. and we  can keep tract of profile/web visits using GOOGLE ANALYTICS.




# git hub Repo.

so here once i was done with the code i had 

npm run start to check and run the application.

then
 
npm run build 

to build the final production.
and then i have commited all the changes of my PROD and then push into GIT REPO.
